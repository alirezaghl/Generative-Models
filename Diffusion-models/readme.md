# DDPM MNIST Implementation

A PyTorch implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) trained on the MNIST dataset. This implementation is based on the assignments from 6.S978 Deep Generative Models (MIT EECS, Fall 2024).

## Overview

This implementation includes:
- A U-Net architecture with residual connections and time embeddings
- DDPM training and sampling procedures
- Visualization of generated samples and intermediate diffusion steps
